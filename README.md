Dependencies used in the project: `<cors>, <express>, <sqlite3>, <nodejs>`

Use any package manager but npm's good.

### How to run Locally:

Open source code and check if all dependencies are installed.

If all are installed properly, `<run node app.js>` in the terminal, a verification string `<Server is running on http://localhost:3000>` will be shown if done properly.

The link is [http://localhost:3000/items](%E2%80%B8http://localhost:3000/items) for the table (only the name part is shown in the Web Page), the localhost only shows full contents of each datas.

### Accessing Mock Webpage:
